In this lecture we learn about Heading, Paragraphs and Links.

So, 

lets learn the basic :

1. **Heading (H1-H6):**
   - Headings in HTML are used to define the titles or subtitles of a webpage's sections.
   - They are represented by the `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>` tags, with `<h1>` being the highest level (most important) heading and `<h6>` being the lowest level (least important) heading.
   - Headings provide structure and hierarchy to the content, making it easier for users and search engines to understand the organization of the webpage.

   Example:
  
   <h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>
   <h2>This is a Subheading</h2>
   <h3>This is a Sub-subheading</h3>

   You can refer also heading&paragraph.html file. 


2. **Paragraph (P):**
   - Paragraphs in HTML are used to define blocks of text or content.
   - They are represented by the `<p>` tag.
   - Paragraphs are commonly used for textual content such as articles, descriptions, or any other form of written content.

   Example:
  
   <p>This is a paragraph. It contains some text.</p>

   You can refer also heading&paragraph.html file. 


3. **Links (Anchor):**
   - Links in HTML are used to create clickable connections between different webpages or different sections within the same webpage.
   - They are represented by the `<a>` (anchor) tag, with the `href` attribute specifying the URL of the destination.
   - Links allow users to navigate between webpages or access additional resources related to the content.

   Example:
  
   <a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Example Website</a>

   You can refer also link.html file. 


These elements are essential for structuring and organizing content in HTML documents, providing both semantic meaning and interactivity to webpages.
