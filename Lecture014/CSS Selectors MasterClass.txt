Selectors in CSS are patterns used to select and style elements in an HTML document. They vary in specificity, meaning how precisely 
they target elements, and in the range of elements they can select. Here's a breakdown of the main types of selectors and their
differences:

1. **Basic Element Selectors:**
   - Targets specific HTML elements by their tag name (e.g., `header`, `nav`, `section`).
   - Example: `header { ... }`

2. **Class Selectors:**
   - Targets elements with a specific class attribute value.
   - Written as a period (`.`) followed by the class name.
   - Example: `.about-info { ... }`

3. **ID Selectors:**
   - Targets a single element with a specific ID attribute value.
   - Written as a hash (`#`) followed by the ID name.
   - Example: `#recent-posts { ... }`

4. **Attribute Selectors:**
   - Targets elements with specific attribute values.
   - Written in square brackets with the attribute name and optional value.
   - Example: `img[alt="About Us Image"] { ... }`

5. **Pseudo-classes:**
   - Targets elements in specific states or conditions.
   - Written with a colon (`:`) followed by the pseudo-class name.
   - Example: `nav a:hover { ... }`

6. **Pseudo-elements:**
   - Targets a part of an element or generates content before or after an element.
   - Written with double colons (`::`) followed by the pseudo-element name.
   - Example: `footer::before { ... }`

Each type of selector offers different levels of specificity and flexibility in selecting elements, allowing for precise and 
efficient styling of HTML content.
