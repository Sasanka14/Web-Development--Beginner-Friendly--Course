HTML is a skeleton of a web page.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is like the skin and makeup of a webpage. It's used to style the HTML content, defining how elements should look,
such as colors, fonts, layouts, and animations.

JavaScript is like the muscles and brain of a webpage. It adds interactivity and functionality, allowing you to dynamically change content,
respond to user actions, validate forms, create animations, and much more.
