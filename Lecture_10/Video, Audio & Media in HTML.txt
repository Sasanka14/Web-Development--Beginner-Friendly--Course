This tutorial provides an in-depth exploration of the `<video>` ,`<audio>` and media tags in 
HTML, offering insights into embedding media files seamlessly within webpages.

1. **The `<video>` Tag:**
The `<video>` tag serves to incorporate video files into HTML documents. It boasts 
various attributes to regulate video playback, enhancing user interaction and experience. 
Examples of key attributes include:
- `src`: Specifies the path to the video file.
- `controls`: Adds video controls such as play, pause, and volume adjustment.
- `autoplay`: Initiates video playback automatically upon page load.
- `loop`: Enables video looping, restarting playback once it ends.
- `muted`: Defaults the video to a muted state.
- `poster`: Sets an image to display before video playback begins.
- `width` and `height`: Define the dimensions of the video display area.

2. **The `<audio>` Tag:**
The `<audio>` tag facilitates the embedding of audio files within HTML documents. 
Similar to the `<video>` tag, it offers a range of attributes for control and 
customization, including:
- `src`: Specifies the path to the audio file.
- `controls`: Integrates audio controls for functionalities like play, pause, and volume adjustment.
- `autoplay`: Automatically commences audio playback upon page load.
- `loop`: Allows audio looping for continuous playback.
- `muted`: Sets the audio to a muted state by default.
- `preload`: Determines if and how the audio should be loaded when the page loads, with options including 'auto', 'metadata', and 'none'.

**Conclusion:**
The `<video>` and `<audio>` tags, along with their associated attributes, empower 
developers to seamlessly embed media content within HTML documents, fostering an engaging 
and interactive user experience. By leveraging these tags effectively, web developers can 
enrich their webpages with multimedia elements, enhancing both functionality and 
aesthetic appeal.


**SVG in HTML:**

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) has become an essential component of contemporary web 
development, offering unparalleled flexibility and quality for creating graphics. 
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and differs from raster images by being composed 
of vectorsâ€”mathematical formulas describing shapes, paths, and fills. This allows SVGs to 
be resized indefinitely without compromising quality, making them ideal for responsive 
web design. There are several reasons to use SVG:

1. **Scalability:** SVG images can be scaled infinitely without losing clarity, ensuring 
                    they look crisp at any size or resolution, which is crucial for 
                    responsive web design.
  
2. **File Size:** SVG files tend to be smaller than raster images, particularly for 
                  simple shapes and icons, leading to faster loading times and improved 
                  performance.

3. **Flexibility:** SVGs can be styled, animated, and manipulated using CSS and 
                    JavaScript, offering developers a wide range of possibilities for 
                    creativity and interactivity.

Embedding SVG in HTML can be achieved in various ways:

- **Inline SVG:** Writing SVG XML code directly within HTML.
- **Using `<img>` Tag:** Specifying the SVG file path in the src attribute of an
                         `<img>` tag.
- **Using CSS:** Setting SVG as a background image in a CSS file.

SVG attributes allow for precise control over its behavior:

- `width` and `height`: Define the dimensions of the SVG.
- `viewBox`: Sets the coordinate system for scaling and positioning.
- `fill` and `stroke`: Determines the colors of the shapes and outlines.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, SVG empowers developers to add scalable and interactive graphics to HTML 
documents seamlessly, enhancing the visual appeal and functionality of webpages across
different devices and screen sizes.


**iFrames in HTML:**

1. What is an iFrame?
An iFrame is an HTML element that facilitates the embedding of external content within
a webpage, creating a designated area where another web page can be loaded. This allows 
for the integration of diverse content from external sources into a single webpage.

2. Why Use iFrames?
iFrames serve various purposes, including:

1. **Content Isolation:** iFrames enable the isolation of third-party content, 
                          enhancing security by containing potentially untrusted 
                          content within a confined space.

2. **Modularity:** They provide an easy way to embed external plugins, widgets, or 
                   content, enhancing the functionality and interactivity of webpages.

3. **Resource Separation:** Content loaded within an iFrame can load separately from the 
                            rest of the page, preventing conflicts and ensuring smoother 
                            performance.

**Basic Syntax:**

The basic syntax of an iFrame is straightforward:

<iframe src="URL" width="width" height="height"></iframe>


**Attributes of iFrame:**

Several attributes can enhance the functionality of an iFrame:

- **src:** Specifies the URL of the page to embed.
- **height and width:** Define the dimensions of the iFrame.
- **frameborder:** Indicates whether to display a border around the iFrame.
- **scrolling:** Controls the appearance of scrollbars within the iFrame.
- **name:** Provides a name for targeting the iFrame in JavaScript.

**Practical Examples:**

iFrames can be used to embed various types of content, such as:

- **Embedding a YouTube Video:**

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


- **Embedding Google Maps:**

<iframe src="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=LOCATION&output=embed" frameborder="0"></iframe>


**Conclusion:**
iFrames offer a convenient and versatile solution for integrating external content 
into web pages, enhancing their functionality and user experience. Their flexibility 
and ease of use make them invaluable tools for modern web development, empowering
developers to create dynamic and interactive webpages efficiently.
