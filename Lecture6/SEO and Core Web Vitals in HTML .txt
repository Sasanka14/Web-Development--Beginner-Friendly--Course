In this lecture we learn SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML

So lets begin,

    Q1. What is SEO ?
---> SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of improving a website's visibility and ranking in search
     engine results. It involves optimizing content, keywords, technical aspects, and user experience to attract 
     more organic traffic and improve online presence.
             here's a short example illustrating how SEO works:

                 Let's say you own a small bakery in New York City called "Sweet Delights Bakery" and you want to attract more customers to your website.

                      A. Keyword Research: You research popular keywords related to your business, such as "best cupcakes in NYC" or "artisanal pastries Manhattan".

                      B. On-Page Optimization: You optimize your website's pages by including these keywords naturally in your page titles, meta descriptions, headings, and content. For example, your homepage title might be "Sweet Delights Bakery - Best Cupcakes in NYC".

                      C. Off-Page Optimization: You work on building backlinks from local food blogs, directories, and social media profiles to your bakery's website. These backlinks signal to search engines that your site is reputable and relevant.

                      D. Technical SEO: You ensure that your website is technically sound by fixing broken links, optimizing page load speed, and making it mobile-friendly. This ensures that search engine bots can crawl and index your site efficiently.

                      E. User Experience: You focus on providing a great user experience by designing an easy-to-navigate website with mouthwatering images of your pastries, clear contact information, and an intuitive ordering system.

                      F. Content Quality: You regularly update your blog with posts about baking tips, behind-the-scenes stories, and seasonal specials. This not only engages your audience but also attracts more visitors through long-tail keywords.

                      G. Analytics and Monitoring: You use tools like Google Analytics to track your website's performance, monitor traffic trends, and identify areas for improvement. This helps you measure the effectiveness of your SEO efforts and make data-driven decisions.

As a result of your SEO efforts, your bakery's website starts ranking higher in search engine results for relevant keywords. More people discover your delicious treats online, leading to increased website traffic, foot traffic to your bakery, and ultimately more sales.
    
    Q2. What is CLS ?
----> Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric that measures how much content on a web page moves unexpectedly 
      while it loads. It quantifies the visual stability of a page, with lower scores indicating a more stable 
      and user-friendly experience. CLS is important for preventing layout shifts that can disrupt user 
      interaction and lead to a poor user experience.
      
      You can refer a video "layout-instability2.webm" . or visit a website called "https://web.dev/articles/cls"

  Web developers can minimize CLS by:

A. Ensuring that all elements on the page have defined dimensions and do not change size unexpectedly.
B. Loading and reserving space for dynamic content to prevent sudden shifts.
C. Avoiding inserting content above existing content, which can cause layout jumps.
D. Using animations and transitions carefully to avoid disrupting the layout.
E. Testing pages across different devices and screen sizes to identify and fix layout issues.

  What is a good cls score ?
--> To provide a good user experience, a site must have a CLS score of 0.1 or less. To ensure you're 
    hitting this target for most of your users, we recommend measuring the 75th percentile of page loads, 
    segmented across mobile and desktop devices.

    Q3. What is a LCP ?
----> Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is a Core Web Vitals metric that measures the time it takes for the largest
    content element on a web page to become visible to the user. It helps assess the perceived loading speed of 
    a page's main content. A fast LCP score indicates that users can see and interact with the most important 
    part of the page quickly, leading to a better user experience and higher satisfaction.


  What is good lcp score
--> To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have LCP of 2.5 seconds or less. To ensure you're 
    hitting this target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page 
    loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices.

   Q4. What is a FID ?
----> First Input Delay (FID) measures the time it takes for a web page to respond to a user's first interaction
      like clicking a button. It reflects the page's responsiveness. To minimize FID:

1. Optimize JavaScript execution.
2. Reduce main thread work.
3. Defer non-critical JavaScript.
4. Minimize third-party scripts.
5. Improve server response time.
6. Utilize web workers.
7. Test and monitor performance regularly.

    What is good fid score ?
---> To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have a First Input Delay of 100 milliseconds
     or less. To ensure you're hitting this target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 
     75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices.

    Q5. what is lighthouse report ? How to generate ?
---> A Lighthouse report is a comprehensive analysis of a web page's performance, accessibility, best practices, 
     SEO, and Progressive Web App (PWA) features. It provides detailed insights and actionable recommendations 
     for optimizing website performance and user experience.
     Lighthouse generates reports by running a series of audits on a web page. These audits examine various 
     aspects of the page, including:
     A. Performance: Measures aspects such as load time, time to interactive, and resource efficiency.
     B. Accessibility: Checks for accessibility issues such as color contrast, aria attributes, and keyboard 
     navigation.
     C. Best Practices: Evaluates adherence to web development best practices, including secure browsing, 
     caching policies, and HTTP status codes.
     D. SEO: Assesses how well the page is optimized for search engine visibility, including meta tags, 
     headings, and structured data.
     E. Progressive Web App (PWA): Determines if the page meets the criteria for a Progressive Web App, 
     including offline capabilities, responsiveness, and app-like behavior.

               To generate a Lighthouse report, we can use Chrome DevTools methods:

                Using Chrome DevTools:

    Step 1.Open Google Chrome browser and navigate to the webpage you want to analyze.
    Step 2.Right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect" or press F12 to open Chrome DevTools.
    Step 3.In DevTools, go to the "Audits" tab.
    Step 4.Click on the "Run audits" button.
    Step 5.After the audit is complete, you'll see a report with scores and recommendations.
