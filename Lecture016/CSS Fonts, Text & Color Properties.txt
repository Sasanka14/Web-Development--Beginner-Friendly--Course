In this lecture we learn about CSS Fonts, Text & Color Properties

Certainly! Here's a structured overview of CSS Fonts, Text, and Color properties, including notes on fallback fonts and external fonts:

### CSS Fonts, Text, and Color Properties

#### 1. Font Properties:
   - Font properties in CSS are used to control the appearance of text on webpages.
   - **font-family**: Specifies the font family for text content.
   - **font-size**: Sets the size of the font.
   - **font-weight**: Specifies the boldness of the font.
   - **font-style**: Specifies the style of the font (italic, oblique, etc.).
   - **font-variant**: Controls the usage of small-caps for the font.
   - **font-stretch**: Specifies the width of the font.
   - **font**: Shorthand property for setting all font properties in one declaration.

#### 2. Text Properties:
   - Text properties in CSS are used to style and format the text content of HTML elements. These properties allow developers to 
     control aspects such as text color, alignment, decoration, spacing, and more.
   - **color**: Sets the color of text content.
   - **text-align**: Aligns text content horizontally within its container.
   - **text-decoration**: Adds decoration to text content (underline, overline, etc.).
   - **text-transform**: Controls the capitalization of text (uppercase, lowercase, etc.).
   - **text-shadow**: Adds shadow effects to text content.
   - **line-height**: Sets the height of lines within text content.
   - **letter-spacing**: Adjusts the spacing between characters.
   - **word-spacing**: Adjusts the spacing between words.
   - **white-space**: Specifies how white space within text content is handled.

#### 3. Color Properties:
   - Color properties in CSS are used to define and manipulate the color of elements on a webpage. They allow developers to specify the 
     color of text, backgrounds, borders, and other visual elements. 

   - **color**: Sets the foreground color of an element's text content.
   - **background-color**: Sets the background color of an element.
   - **opacity**: Specifies the transparency of an element's content.
   - **hsl()**: Function for specifying a color using the HSL color model.
   - **currentColor**: Represents the value of the `color` property of an element.

   Colors in CSS can be represented in various ways:

1. **Color Name**: Predefined color names like "red," "blue," or "green."

2. **Hex Code**: Hexadecimal codes ranging from #000000 (black) to #FFFFFF (white), representing RGB values.

3. **RGB Values**: Specify colors using RGB components, like rgb(255, 0, 0) for red.

4. **RGBA Values**: Include an alpha channel for transparency, like rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5) for semi-transparent red.

#### Fallback Fonts:
   - Fallback fonts are specified in case a specified font is not available or cannot be loaded.
   - They are listed in a comma-separated list after the desired font in the `font-family` property.
   - Example: `font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;`
   - It's essential to include generic font families like `sans-serif` or `serif` as fallbacks for broader compatibility.

#### External Fonts:
   - External fonts are hosted on external servers or services, allowing web developers to use a wide variety of typefaces.
   - Common sources include Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts, and Font Squirrel.
   - They are included in HTML documents using `<link>` tags or `@import` rules in CSS.
   - External fonts enhance typography and design options for websites.


By understanding and applying these CSS properties effectively, web developers can control the appearance and styling of text content,
 including font choices, text layout, and color schemes, ensuring a visually appealing and readable user experience.


  You can take a reference of "color.html" and "index.html".
