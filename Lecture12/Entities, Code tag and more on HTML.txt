In this lecture we learn about Entities, Code tag and more

So Let's begin,

                                   HTML Entities
HTML entities are a crucial part of HTML markup language. They enable you to display 
characters that are reserved in HTML or that aren't readily available on the keyboard. 
In this blog, we'll explore what HTML entities are, their types, and how to use them.

   Q1. What Are HTML Entities?
----> HTML entities are used to represent special characters in a format that the browser can 
       understand. They start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).

    Q2. Why Use HTML Entities?
-----> Here are some reasons:
      1. Reserved Characters: Characters like <, >, and & are reserved in HTML.
      2. Special Symbols: For symbols like Â©, Â®, or mathematical symbols.
      3. Non-Breaking Spaces: To create white spaces that won't break into a new line.

Common HTML Entities
&lt;  for <
&gt;  for >
&amp; for &
&nbsp; for a non-breaking space
&copy; for Â©

How to Use HTML Entities:
-------------> Using Reserved Characters
                <p>The price is 10 &lt; 20.</p>
--------------> Displaying Special Symbols
                <p>Copyright &copy; 2023.</p>
---------------> Creating Non-Breaking Spaces
                 <p>This is an example&nbsp;text.</p>

 HTML quotation tags, specifically <blockquote> for block quotations and <q> for inline quotations. Here's a summary of the key points covered:

     Q3. What Are <blockquote> and <q> Tags?
       ðŸ‘‰<blockquote>: Used for longer, block-level quotes.
       ðŸ‘‰<q>: Used for shorter, inline quotes.
     Q4. Why Use These Tags?
------> They provide semantic meaning to quotations, aiding search engines in 
         understanding content relevance.
   Basic Syntax:
   ðŸ‘‰ <blockquote> Tag:

<blockquote cite="source-url">
    Quotation text here.
</blockquote>

    ðŸ‘‰ <q> Tag:

<q cite="source-url">Quotation text here.</q>

     Attributes:
1. Both tags support the cite attribute:
2. cite: Specifies the URL of the quote's source.

Practical Examples:
Using <blockquote> for Long Quotes:

<blockquote cite="https://example.com">
    This is a long quote from an external source. This quote can span multiple lines and paragraphs.
</blockquote>

Using <q> for Short, Inline Quotes:

The philosopher said, <q cite="https://example.com">The unexamined life is not worth living.</q>

Styling with CSS:
These tags can be styled using CSS to match the aesthetics of the website.
