In this lecture we learn basic and various aspect of html. 

Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the basic structure of HTML and explanations of common HTML elements:

1. **Basic Structure of HTML:**
   
   HTML documents consist of elements that define the structure and content of a webpage. The basic structure of an HTML document includes:
   
    <!-- Defines the document type as HTML5 -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <!-- Begins the HTML document -->
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <!-- Sets the character encoding to UTF-8 -->
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <!-- Configures viewport settings for responsive design -->
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <!-- Sets the title of the webpage -->
        <title>Title of the Webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Content of the Webpage Goes Here -->
    </body>
    </html>


2. **Opening and Closing Tags:**

   - Opening Tag: An opening tag is used to mark the beginning of an HTML element and is enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`). It contains the name of the element.
   
   - Closing Tag: A closing tag marks the end of an HTML element and is also enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`). It contains a forward slash (`/`) followed by the name of the element.

   Example:

   <p>This is an opening tag</p>
  

3. **Types of Tags:**

   - **Pair Tags**: Pair tags consist of both opening and closing tags, enclosing content between them. Examples include `<p>`, `<div>`, `<span>`, etc.
   
   - **Self-Closing Tags**: Self-closing tags do not have a closing tag and are used to insert elements that do not contain content or require additional attributes. Examples include `<img>`, `<br>`, `<input>`, etc.

4. **Meta Tag:**

   The `<meta>` tag is used to provide metadata about the HTML document. Metadata includes information such as character encoding, viewport settings, authorship, keywords, and descriptions. The `<meta>` tag is self-closing and is commonly placed within the `<head>` section of an HTML document.

   Example:

   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
