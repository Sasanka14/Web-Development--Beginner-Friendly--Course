In this video we learn about Images, Lists and Tables.


As we know that we can upload Images in first lecture but at that time we don't explain.
So, 
   Lets, begin

**1. Images:**
   - Images make your webpage visually appealing and engaging.
   - Use the `<img>` tag to add images. Specify the image source (`src`) attribute to tell the browser where to find the image.
   - The `alt` attribute provides alternative text for screen readers and when the image cannot be displayed.
   - You can adjust the size of the image using the `width` and `height` attributes.

**2. Lists:**
   - Lists help organize information in a structured way.
   - There are two types of lists: ordered lists (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`).
   - Inside list elements, use `<li>` tags for each item.
   - Ordered lists are numbered, while unordered lists use bullets.
   - Additionally, there is a third type of list called a definition list (<dl>), which is used for term/definition pairs.
   - We can customize ordered and unordered list by using "type" attribute

**3. Tables:**
   - Tables are useful for displaying data in rows and columns.
   - Use the `<table>` tag to create a table and `<tr>` for rows.
   - Inside each row, use `<td>` for data cells.
   - You can use `<th>` for table headers.
   - Attributes like `colspan` and `rowspan` let you span cells across rows or columns.

**Tips:**
   - Optimize images for the web to ensure faster loading times.
   - Use descriptive alt text for images for accessibility.
   - Choose the appropriate list type based on the content hierarchy.
   - Keep tables simple and avoid using them for layout purposes.


These notes provide a beginner-friendly overview of images, lists, and tables, helping you structure your webpage content effectively. Happy coding!
