In this lecture we learn about semantic tags 

So Let's begin,

   Q1. What is Semantic Tags ?
----> Semantic tags in HTML are elements that convey meaning about the content they 
      contain, beyond just presentation. They provide structure and context to the content,
       making it more understandable to both humans and search engines. Semantic tags help
       in creating a clear and organized document outline, improving accessibility and SEO.
       
    Here are some of the key semantic tags you must know about:
1. <header>: Used to represent the top section of a web page, often containing headings, 
             logos, and navigation.
2. <nav>: Signifies a navigation menu on a web page.
3. <article>: Indicates a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news 
              article.
4. <section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content on a web page.
5. <aside>: Typically used for sidebars or content that is tangentially related to the 
            main content.
6. <footer>: Represents the footer of a web page, usually containing copyright information
             and contact details.
7. <figure> and <figcaption>: Used for embedding images, diagrams, or charts, along with 
                              a caption.
8. <main>: Signifies the main content area of a web page.
9. <time>: Used to represent time-related information, like dates and times.

   Q2. Why Use Semantic Tags?
-----> They enhance SEO, improve accessibility, and make your code easier to read and
       maintain.
