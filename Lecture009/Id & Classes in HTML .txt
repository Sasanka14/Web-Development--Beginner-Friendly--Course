In this lecture we learn about Id and Classes

So Let's begin,

1. **IDs and Classes:**

- **ID Attribute:** The `id` attribute in HTML is used to uniquely identify an element 
within a document. Each ID must be unique within the HTML document, meaning no two 
elements can have the same ID. IDs are often used to apply specific styles or target 
elements with JavaScript.

- **Class Attribute:** The `class` attribute in HTML is used to define one or more class 
names for an element. Unlike IDs, classes can be applied to multiple elements within a 
document, allowing for styling and behavior to be applied consistently across different 
elements.

2. **Usage:**

- **ID Usage:** IDs are typically used to uniquely identify important elements within a 
document, such as headers, navigation bars, or sections. They are often targeted by CSS 
rules or JavaScript functions for styling or functionality.

- **Class Usage:** Classes are used to apply styles or behavior to multiple elements that 
share similar characteristics. For example, you might use a class to style all the buttons
 on a webpage consistently or to apply a specific layout to a group of elements.

3. **Syntax:**

- **ID Syntax:** `<element id="unique_id">Content</element>`

- **Class Syntax:** `<element class="class1 class2">Content</element>`

**Example:**

<div id="header">
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
</div>

<div class="container">
    <p>This is a paragraph with some text.</p>
</div>


In this example, the `id="header"` attribute uniquely identifies the header `<div>` 
element, while the `class="container"` attribute applies the `container` class to the 
second `<div>` element.

**Notes:**

- **Uniqueness:** IDs must be unique within a document, while classes can be reused 
across multiple elements.

- **Styling vs. Functionality:** IDs are often used for targeting elements for styling or 
functionality, while classes are primarily used for styling purposes.

- **CSS Selectors:** Both IDs and classes can be targeted using CSS selectors to apply 
styles or behavior to specific elements.

Understanding the differences and usage of IDs and classes is essential for effective 
HTML document structuring and styling.
