This is the First Lecture of the CSS. 

So Let's begin,

   Q1. what is CSS ?
-----> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
       of a document written in markup languages like HTML. CSS defines how HTML elements are to be displayed 
       on a screen, paper, or other media. It enables web designers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and 
       other visual aspects of web pages, ensuring consistency and enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal. 
       CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styling rules to them, allowing for both simple and 
       complex design implementations.

   Q2. Types of CSS ?
------> There are three main types of CSS:

1. **Inline CSS:** This type of CSS is applied directly within the HTML element using the
                   "style" attribute. It has the highest specificity, meaning it overrides 
                   any external or internal CSS styles. However, it's generally not 
                   recommended for large-scale styling due to its lack of maintainability.

2. **Internal CSS:** Internal CSS is defined within the HTML document using the `<style>` 
                     tag in the `<head>` section. It applies styles to the entire document
                    or specific sections. While it offers better maintainability than 
                    inline CSS, it still mixes content with presentation, which can make 
                    the code harder to manage in larger projects.

3. **External CSS:** External CSS is stored in separate .css files and linked to the HTML 
                     document using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section. This 
                     approach keeps the HTML and CSS separate, making the code cleaner, 
                     more organized, and easier to maintain. External CSS files can be 
                     reused across multiple web pages, promoting consistency in design 
                     and layout.

   Q3. What is selector ?
-----> A selector in CSS is a pattern or expression used to select one or more elements 
       in an HTML document that you want to style. Selectors target HTML elements based 
       on their element type, attributes, IDs, classes, or their relationship with other 
       elements. Once selected, you can apply styles to these elements to change their 
       appearance, layout, or behavior on the web page. Selectors form a fundamental part 
       of CSS and are essential for targeting specific elements to apply styling rules.

   Q4. What is property ?
-----> In CSS, a property is a characteristic or attribute of an HTML element that you 
       can style or manipulate using CSS rules. Properties define various aspects of an 
       element's appearance, such as its color, size, font, spacing, alignment, and more. 
       For example, the "color" property sets the text color, the "font-size" property 
       controls the size of the text, and the "background-color" property defines the 
       background color of an element. Each property has a corresponding value that 
       specifies the desired style or behavior for the element.
