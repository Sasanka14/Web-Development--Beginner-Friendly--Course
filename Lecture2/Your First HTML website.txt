In this lecture first We learn connect .html with .css and .js file type. As a result we first crete three files 
names : index.html, style.css and script.js.(You can any name) 

Now, 
    With the help of extension create a boilerplate(Boilerplate code is computer language text that you can reuse with little or no 
                                                    alteration in several different contexts.) for .html and  with the help of extension preview
    the code in browser and see how it looks like.

Then we do some styling in .css file. after styling we go to .html file and write " <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> " this line of code
which connect .html with .css file. and we see changes in browser with the help of preview extension.

In similar way we connect the .js file with .html file using "<script src="script.js"></script>" this line of code.
